\section{Testing Platform}
\subsection{Java Version}
The testing harness was run on Java version 1.8.0\_31.\\
\subsection{Verifying Reliability}
To test the reliability of the Null- and SynchronizedState models, I ensure that the initial sum of values was equal to the final sum of values. I also checked that each value was within range; that is, greater than or equal to the minimum and less than or equal to the maximum possible value.\\

When the harness \texttt{UnsafeMemory} is run, the initial and final sums of the values in the model will be printed out, as well as a message indicating whether the two values differ. Upon success, \texttt{Sum remained constant!} will be printed to the screen.\\

Similarly, the test harness will print \texttt{All within range!} if every value in the state model is within range at the end of the simulation.
\section{New Models}
\subsection{Unsynchronized}
The \texttt{Unsynchronized} model is the same as its \texttt{Synchronized} counterpart, except that it does not use the \texttt{Synchronized} keyword. Accordingly, there are occasionally disparities in the initial final sum of values.
